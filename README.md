### Howdy! 👋👩‍💻
I'm Ruth (she/her), a software engineer who lives and works (remotely) in Denver, CO.

🌱
I’m currently learning Python and continuing to sharpen my skills in PHP, JS, Node and React.

👯
I’m looking to collaborate on projects in environment and education.


🤔
I'm new to the tech industry, so any advice or mentorship (big or small) is much appreciated!


💬
Ask me about beans. How to grow them, how to make them, how to eat them. I'm usually thinking about beans.

👩‍🌾
Aside from web dev, I am a master gardener with a background in ecology. I can usually be found tooling around my backyard garden shooing my chickens out of the strawberry patch. Send me pictures of any weird bugs you find, I was an entomology lab tech for a while, so I am pretty good at insect ID.
