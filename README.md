### Howdy! 👋👩‍💻
I'm Ruth (she/her), a software engineer who lives and works in Denver, CO.

🌱 
I’m currently learning Python and continuing to sharpen my skills in PHP, JS, Node and React. If you need any CSS advice, I've got that pretty well sorted at this point.

👯 
I’m looking to collaborate on environment and education projects.

🤔
I'm new to the tech industry, so any advice or mentorship (big of small) is much appreciated!

💬
Ask me about beans. How to grow them, how to make them, how to eat them. I'm usually thinking about beans.

📫
How to reach me: email or on twitter usually has your best shot of reaching me.

👩‍🌾
Aside from web dev, I am a master gardener with a background in ecology. I can usually be found tooling around my backyard garden shooing my chickens out of the strawberry patch.
