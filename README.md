### Howdy! 👋👩‍💻
I'm Ruth (she/her), a software engineer who lives and works in Denver, CO. Currently at segment.

🌱
I’m continuing to learn Python and sharpen my skills in PHP, JavaScript, Node and React.

👯
I'd also love to collaborate on any projects in education and environment, so reach out!


🤔
I'm still new to the tech industry, so any advice or mentorship (big or small) is much appreciated!


💬
Ask me about beans. How to grow them, how to make them, how to eat them. I'm usually thinking about beans.

👩‍🌾
Aside from web development, I am a master gardener with a background in ecology. I can usually be found in my backyard garden shooing my chickens out of the strawberry patch. Send me pictures of any weird bugs you find, I was an entomology lab tech for a while, so I'm pretty good at insect ID. 🐛
