### Howdy! 👋👩‍💻
I'm Ruth (she/her), a software engineer who lives and works in Denver, CO.

🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱🌱

I’m currently learning Python and continuing to sharpen my skills in PHP, JS, Node and React. If you need any CSS advice, I've got that pretty well sorted at this point.

I’m looking to collaborate on environment and education projects.

I'm new to the tech industry, so any advice or mentorship (big of small) is much appreciated!

Ask me about beans. How to grow them, how to make them, how to eat them. I'm usually thinking about beans.

Aside from web dev, I am a master gardener with a background in ecology. I can usually be found tooling around my backyard garden shooing my chickens out of the strawberry patch.
